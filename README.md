# dotfiles
My amazing dotfiles for Linux, including i3wm, picom, starship.rs, and many others!

# Important notes:
- Some of these require nonfree software like fonts or nvidia drivers or whatnot, but can be modified so they do not
- I am using these on Fedora, some names might be different on Arch or Debian
- Some stuff from my i3config is x11-exclusive. I try to use wayland-compatible alternatives wherever possible because I also use Wayland sometimes, but I could not find good alternatives sometimes
- A lot of this requires FiraCode Nerd Font, google it
- I am going to be replacing some shell scripts pretty soon btw
- Dependencies are listed in the configs/shellscripts. Always look before you leap!
- I am on a laptop and some of these scripts only make sense on an Asus laptop.

# Incomplete list of dependencies
- i3status-rust
- Microsoft fonts (stolen from windows 11 partition)
- supergfxctl
- starship.rs
- kitty
- neovim
- zenity
- rofi
- Gradience (for gtk4)
- Wayfire (I think)
- FiraCode Nerd Font

# Less-important notes
- ~/.local/share/file-manager is for custom pcmanfm actions
- my i3 VI mode is kinda awful

Please let me know if you find any sensitive info, I don't think there was any but just to be sure
